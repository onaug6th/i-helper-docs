# introduce

i-helper is a desktop application that contains convenient plug-in tools. You can install the plug-in tools you need. At the same time, you can develop a plug-in by yourself and publish it to the plug-in store, so that other people can use your work together.

### Development background

One day, I copied the code back and forth between different projects. Frequent switching of editors makes me feel cumbersome. I was thinking: "It would be much more convenient if I could write a tool, copy all the content, and then copy it out one by one."

At this time, my colleague came next to me and saw that the memo tool on my computer desktop was filled with dense work items. Said that he also wanted to use one, let me open it for him. As a result, it was found on his computer that he had a win7 system and did not have his own note tool.

Apart from anything else, I immediately used `electron` to write a simple desktop application called `iHelper`, which contains several small functions: notes, clipboard records, to-do items....

After finishing the `iHelper`, I sent it to my colleagues. At this time, my T colleague suddenly said something. "I also want to write something, can I add it to your iHelper?"

Of course. Just as I was about to add my colleagues to the warehouse developer members, I thought: **"If iHelper can support running other peopleâ€™s web projects, like WeChat applets. Will it be possible to get more front-end colleagues to participate? Add what you want~~wheels~~tools"**

So I thought about it, continued research, and changed it to a plug-in platform that supports download and installation. And record the process of sharing it.
